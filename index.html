      <h1>Abdul Sattar Edhi</h1>
  
      <p>&emsp;&emsp; Very few personalities in the world dedicated their entire life for 
        the philanthropic work. Adbul Sattar Edhi, the founder of Edhi Foundation,
        is one of these few individuals. Born on January 1, 1928, Gujarat, British India
        (now part of Gujarat, India), Edhi had a philanthropic mind from his very early age.
      </p>
  
      <p>&emsp;&emsp; Edhi's charitable activities expanded greatly in 1957 when an Asian flu 
        epidemic (originating in China) swept through Pakistan and the rest of the world. 
        Donations allowed him to buy his first ambulance the same year.</p>
      
      <p>&emsp;&emsp; Over his lifetime, 
        the Edhi Foundation expanded, backed entirely by private donations, which included 
        establishing a network of 1,800 ambulances. By the time of his death, Edhi was 
        registered as a parent or guardian of nearly 20,000 adopted children. He is known 
        amongst Pakistanis as the "Angel of Mercy" and is considered to be Pakistan's most 
        respected and legendary figure. In 2013, The Huffington Post claimed that 
        he might be "the world's greatest living humanitarian".
